Use this repo to connect to google colab from outside

[instruction](https://github.com/barabum0/google-colab-hack/blob/main/TUTORIAL.md)

i think its not a "hack". its just running jupyter server, to use colab's gpu or tpu from outside.

but in right hands, and a bunch of google accounts, u can use it like a multiple gpus



**remember**, that if u use Colab Free u r limited for 12 hours per day.
